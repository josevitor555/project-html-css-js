# project-html-css-js
My first project made in HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Front-End Dev)
#Comments:
- This project was made in an application called "Spck Editor";
- In its free version on Google Play.
- The project can only run on smartphone screens, and its screen cannot be "messy" when opening the project on a PC.
